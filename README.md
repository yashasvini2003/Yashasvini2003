## 🌻 My Journey

From the first lines of code that sparked a sense of wonder, I’ve pursued software not just as a craft, but as a calling—to create tools, experiences, and connections that make lives better.

I believe in code that is **clean**, but also **kind**. In products that are not just scalable, but **thoughtful**.  
Every bug fixed is a lesson. Every feature shipped is an opportunity to touch someone’s world.

- 💡 **Curiosity is my superpower:** I never stop exploring—from backend algorithms to frontend polish, from the depths of system design to the heights of user delight.
- 🤝 **Collaboration is my joy:** The best software is built together. I cherish every brainstorm, every code review, every shared “aha!” moment.
- 🌱 **Growth is my mission:** I learn relentlessly—so I can teach, mentor, and help others rise with me.
- 💬 **Empathy is my secret ingredient:** Technology is ultimately about people, and I strive to always remember that.
- 🌏 **Open source is my home:** I contribute, not just code, but care—to projects and communities that matter.
